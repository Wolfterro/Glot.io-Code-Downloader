---------------------------------------------

CHANGELOG
=========

VERSION 1.2
 - Changes in the program's code:
 --- Program now uses JSON parsing by using the glot.io API to get the snippet's code, instead of web scrapping for it
 --- Removed the BeautifulSoup library, it's no longer needed because no web scrapping anymore
 --- Snippet directories will be created with their name and ID as the directory's name (e.g.: My Snippet-[0123456789]), avoiding snippets with the same name replacing one another
 --- EXPERIMENTAL: Better support for foreign characters (e.g.: japanese, chinese, korean)

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.1
 - Changes in the program's code:
 --- Better error handling for wrong/invalid URL or lack of Internet connection by using urllib2 urlparser and try/exception
 --- Changed the way to retrieve the snippet's title, it will search for a h2 tag with id 'snippet-title' instead of the page's title
 --- Removed the announcer and announcer_end variables

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.0
 - Initial version of the program
